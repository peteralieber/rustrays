This is my attempt at following the excellent book, [Raytracing In One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html), implemented in Rust.

I am a new Rustacean. In fact, this is my first Rust program. After starting the book without any Rust knowledge, I realized I wanted to implement this in the "Rust" way as much as possible.  Therefore, I took a pause from implementation, read [The Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/), then started again.  

Where I've found a particular change necessary for Rust, or noticed some improvements by implementing in Rust, I note this in comments.
